# Saudi Arabia CPI Forecasting

Contents in this repository consists of an excel file **KSA_CPI_INDICES.xlsx** containing historical CPI data for Saudi Arabia and an Jupytor notebook file named **KSA_CPI_INDEX_FORECASTING.ipynb** containing implementations to consume the data and perform several operations including a number of models evaluations for CPI forecasting.

The code in this repository has been run and tested using Jupytor Notebooks. To run the code:

- Clone the repository on your local machine.
- Start Jupytor Notebooks and open **KSA_CPI_INDEX_FORECASTING.ipynb**
- You can start executing the code blocks sequentially and make sure to wait for each code block execution to complete as some of those operations could take upto a minute (depending on capability of your machine).
- *Please note, you may need to install xgboost library prior to running XGBoost Regression. Instructions are specified within the notebook*.
